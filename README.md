# CSI Prediction on Intel Dev Cloud (Team Quixotic Sapiens - Intel AI Hackathon)
### What is our project about? ###
We have developed an AI-powered customer satisfaction analysis application for businesses leveraging call recordings as input data. This project revolutionises the way businesses understand and improve customer satisfaction by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to analyze call recordings. By extracting valuable insights from customer interactions, the application aims to provide businesses with a comprehensive understanding of customer sentiments, concerns, and satisfaction levels. 

This analysis will enable businesses to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement in their customer service processes and interactions. By leveraging AI-driven sentiment analysis and other advanced techniques, the application seeks to streamline the process of CSI measurement, enabling businesses to proactively address customer needs, enhance customer experiences, and ultimately drive higher levels of satisfaction and loyalty.

### What is CSI? ###
Let's say you're a bank manager, and you want to know how satisfied your customers are with the services you provide. So, you might send out surveys asking questions like, "Were you satisfied with the speed of service?" or "Did our staff assist you well?"

Customers respond, giving their feedback. The bank then compiles this information to create a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI). If the CSI is high, it means most customers are happy with the bank's services. But if it's low, it indicates there might be issues that need to be addressed, like long wait times or unfriendly staff.

So, just like you'd want to make sure your friends had a great time at a party you hosted, the bank wants to ensure their customers are happy with the banking experience. The CSI helps them gauge satisfaction levels and make improvements where needed to keep customers coming back.
